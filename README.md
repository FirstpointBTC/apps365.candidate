## Setup machine

To develop this webpart we used the instructions here:
1. Setup machine for SPFx https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/set-up-your-development-environment
2. Build your first webpart https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part

If you are getting errors with certificates and spfx-serve you might need to do 1. and 2. above and then within your generated webpart directory:
```bash
gulp trust-dev-cert
```
as seen here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/spfx/web-parts/get-started/build-a-hello-world-web-part#preview-the-web-part
